# Movie Resume AI

Movie Resume AI is an intelligent tool designed to help users resume watching their favorite movies or shows after falling asleep or losing track of their place. Users can describe the scene they remember, and the AI will analyze the movie or show and resume playback from the correct spot.

## Features (Planned)
- Accept user input describing the remembered scene.
- Analyze the movie or show for matching scenes.
- Restart playback from the identified point.

## Status
This project is a **work in progress**. Current efforts are focused on:
- Building the AI model for scene analysis.
- Developing the user interface for scene descriptions.
- Integrating with popular streaming platforms.
